# Portfolio

## In progress project:

### Robotics Competition
In a team of 3 and a budget of 2250 CHF, we are tasked with creating a robot that can pick up and unload Legos in an arena. My main task is electronics.

## Relevant Courses

### CS-476 Embedded system design (In progress)

 Hardware-software co-design is a well known concept in embedded system design.It is also a concept required in designing FPGA-accelerators in data-centers.This course teaches how to transform algorithms in smart hardware-software solutions

### MICRO-510 Embedded motor control

The student will be able to design, build, and program a complete motor or actuator control electronic system. They will know how to apply motor control theory to real-world systems.
