## In progress projects:

### Robotic's Competition
In a team of 3 and a budget of 2250 CHF, we are tasked with creating a robot that can pick up and unload Legos in an arena. My main task is electronics.

**Keywords: ROS2, Electronics, CAD (Fusion 360), 3D Printing, Laser cutting, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Machining, Raspberry Pi, Arduino**

### BARK Robot dog (EPFL AI TEAM)
Create a robot dog based on the [DINGO Robot dog](https://github.com/Yerbert/DingoQuadruped). The dog will then be programmed to do tricks using reinforcement learning. My main task is in mechatronics.

**Keywords: ROS, Electronics, CAD (Fusion 360), 3D Printing,**

## Completed Projects

### Small mobile robot with IR sensor (Robopoly)

Designed, built, wired and programmed a small mobile robot in the robotic's makerspace at EPFL. It was a great learning experience in electronics.

**Keywords: Electronics, CAD, Arduino**

### Autonomous drone navigation
In a team of 5 programmed a small drone to navigate autonomously through a maze with obstacles, land on a landing pad and fly back to its initial position. My main task was to design the main Finite State Machine


**Keywords: Programing, FSM, Dijkstra, Cost Map**

### Accelerometer and VGA for FPGA
Developped an interface for the VGA and accelerometer on the DE10-Lite FPGA board. The results of the project are now used in the Digital Logic class at EPFL.

**Keywords: VHDL, SPI, VGA, Digital Logic**

### Autonomous Mobile Robot
Programmed in a team of 4 a robot to avoid obstacles and navigate to a goal. The robot had to be able to localize itself after being moved and even if the camera is blocked. I was responsible of Localization and Computer Vision

**Keywords: Kalman Filter, Dijkstra, Computer Vision**
